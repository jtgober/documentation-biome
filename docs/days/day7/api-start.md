# Api Testing Start!

## What is an API?
Api stands for application programming interface, and it basically acts as an intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each others. So in other words, an api is a messenger that delivers your request to the supplier you are requesting it from, then delivers the response back to you.  

## Why should you test the api and whats the benefit?
Api testing can be difficult for some, and easy for others. The main benefit from api testing is that you can quickly and efficiently create a bunch of tests, in very little time. **Its important to to make sure that the apis is performing as expected when faced with a variety of expected and unexpected requests.**

The most common type of api is RESTful apis, to which we will be learning, but there are others as well such as SOAP and the newer-ish GraphQL.

## What to look for in api testing
Some of the expected results we can verify
* HTTP status codes
* Response Payload
* Headers
* Application State
* Basic Performance Sanity

## What apis will we be testing?
The api's we will be testing are the [pet store api](https://petstore.swagger.io/) and also the [pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co/) for some of the json learning (JavaScript Object Notation) and get requests.
