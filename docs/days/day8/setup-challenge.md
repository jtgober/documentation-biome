We've done this a few times now. So at this point you should have a good idea on what needs to be done to start a new project.

1. Start a project folder called `petstore-api`
2. Initialize playwright 
3. delete out unwanted folders/files
4. comment out 2 of the 3 test runners in the config
5. thats it!
