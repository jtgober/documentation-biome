With the main branch being updated from different team members, we may touch some of the same files and when doing so we may attempt to merge our code, only to find that we have a merge conflict. This is when GIT doesn&#39;t exactly know what to keep, so we need to determine what code we want to hold on to. Code may be redundant, or code we need to get rid of.</p><p>I&#39;m going to head back to our feature/test branch and I&#39;m going to update file1 here and I&#39;m going to show you another git trick that can be used with files that are labeled as modified</p><p>we can commit and add at the same time with modified files, by using this command. the -a just stands for the add and then we can tack on the m for the message</p><div class="language-sh vp-adaptive-theme line-numbers-mode"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang">sh</span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code"><code><span class="line"><span style="--shiki-light:#6F42C1;--shiki-dark:#B392F0;">git</span><span style="--shiki-light:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#9ECBFF;"> commit</span><span style="--shiki-light:#005CC5;--shiki-dark:#79B8FF;"> -am</span><span style="--shiki-light:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#9ECBFF;"> &quot;updated file1 on feature/test&quot;</span></span></code></pre><div class="line-numbers-wrapper" aria-hidden="true"><span class="line-number">1</span><br></div></div><p>keep in mind however, if its a newly created file this will not work</p><p>Now lets swing on over to the main branch and update that same line that we updated in file1 and we see that we are unable because our files will be overwritten. we already know we could stash these changes, but for now, lets just commit our changes.</p><div class="language-sh vp-adaptive-theme line-numbers-mode"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang">sh</span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code"><code><span class="line"><span style="--shiki-light:#6F42C1;--shiki-dark:#B392F0;">git</span><span style="--shiki-light:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#9ECBFF;"> commit</span><span style="--shiki-light:#005CC5;--shiki-dark:#79B8FF;"> -am</span><span style="--shiki-light:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#9ECBFF;"> &quot;updated file1 on main&quot;</span></span></code></pre><div class="line-numbers-wrapper" aria-hidden="true"><span class="line-number">1</span><br></div></div><p>Now we can checkout the feature/test branch and lets try to merge main to the feature test branch</p><div class="language-sh vp-adaptive-theme line-numbers-mode"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang">sh</span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code"><code><span class="line"><span style="--shiki-light:#6F42C1;--shiki-dark:#B392F0;">git</span><span style="--shiki-light:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#9ECBFF;"> checkout</span><span style="--shiki-light:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#9ECBFF;"> feature/test</span></span>
